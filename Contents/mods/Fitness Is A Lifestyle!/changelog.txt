Unstable changes:
V0.2.6:
    - Fixed the calling of player to work in MP

TODO:
    - Check the CheckRegNum to not get active while you are doing exercise. (Not working as intended)
    - Check to modify the MST addon when Prodigy from Dynamic traits is added
    - Add Dynamic Traits to "compatibility"
    - Add Realistic Growth to the XP base gain

Possible features:
    - Affect Sprint and agility based on the Fitness and Strength.
    - The lower the regularity of both, the higher the loss of XP in both (using CheckRegNum)
